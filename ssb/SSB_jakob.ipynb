    "***Instructions*** *This is the template for submitting SSB answers. These instructions are slightly different from SSA, so please read carefully. Copy this file to another file called `SSB_name.ipynb`, where name is your name. Make your edits there, and if you make a mistake deleting a question or code, you can always consult this file again. Write also your name in the space above. This notebook contains all the questions in green blocks for easier visibility. In addition, it also contains the most important bits of code provided so you don't have to copy paste back and forth. Feel free to edit the code if you want, and please delete any code you will not use. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers in the cells below the questions. While only one empty cell appears before the question blocks, feel free to add any quantity of cells (code or Markdown) in the order and quantity you see fit. You can also modify the header below to suit your needs, but please don't use any non-standard packages. If you must, you can include external data files (e.g. temporary results that you saved to avoid long computations), but be sure to include all the code to produce those files. Do not load external code or use any non-standard packages. The whole notebook must run without any errors in the code.*\n",

    "***A note on collaboration*** *Collaborating with other students is encouraged during these exercises, in particular to discuss the questions, possible approaches, and compare solutions. However, do not write the answer as a group. Do not copy the answer from another student. Compose your answers by yourself.*\n",

For this calculation, one usually has to interpolate the $\\tau_{500}$ vs $h$ curve for each line in the model, but a very quick calculation can be made by taking the model height where $\\tau_{500}$ is closest to 1 (nearest neighbour) with `tau1_height = height[numpy.abs(tau - 1).argmin(axis=0)]`, replacing `height` and `tau` by the appropriate arrays.

    "* ***Bonus question*** *(optional, points will be used to make up for lost points elsewhere)*: calculating the partition function relies on having the level energies for several excited states, but in our simple atom we have only two excited states in neutral sodium. Check how far we are from a better partition function by comparing with the recipe given below at 5000 K and 6000 K.\n",

    "* ***Bonus question*** *(optional, points will be used to make up for lost points elsewhere)*: modify the `Atom` class to use the partition function for Na I given by the recipe below, instead of calculating it from the model atom. Use this class for all later calculations. *Hint*: since you are modifying the class, you may as well prevent it from computing the populations of Na II, since these will not be used and will take up twice as much memory.\n",

    "[Gray (1992)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992oasp.book.....G) gives the following recipe for the Na I partition function: $\\log U_{\\rm Na\\,I}(T) \\approx c_0 + c_1 \\log \\theta + c_2 \\log^2 \\theta + c_3 \\log^3 \\theta + c_4 \\log^4 \\theta $ with $\\theta \\equiv 5040./T$ and $c_0 = 0.30955$, $c_1=-0.17778$,    $c_2=1.10594$, $c_3=-2.42847$ and $c_4=1.70721$. In the 2005 version of the book, these fits were replaced by a table, which you can use if you prefer.\n",
