    "***Instructions*** *This is the template for submitting SSB answers. These instructions are slightly different from SSA, so please read carefully. Copy this file to another file called `SSB_name.ipynb`, where name is your name. Make your edits there, and if you make a mistake deleting a question or code, you can always consult this file again. Write also your name in the space above. This notebook contains all the questions in green blocks for easier visibility. In addition, it also contains the most important bits of code provided so you don't have to copy paste back and forth. Feel free to edit the code if you want, and please delete any code you will not use. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers in the cells below the questions. While only one empty cell appears before the question blocks, feel free to add any quantity of cells (code or Markdown) in the order and quantity you see fit. You can also modify the header below to suit your needs, but please don't use any non-standard packages. If you must, you can include external data files (e.g. temporary results that you saved to avoid long computations), but be sure to include all the code to produce those files. Do not load external code or use any non-standard packages. The whole notebook must run without any errors in the code.*\n",

    "***A note on collaboration*** *Collaborating with other students is encouraged during these exercises, in particular to discuss the questions, possible approaches, and compare solutions. However, do not write the answer as a group. Do not copy the answer from another student. Compose your answers by yourself.*\n",

    "  > In the above figures the ratios of mass density of hydrogen, hydrogen and helium combined and the metals to the total mass density is plotted. We see that the distribution is quite chaotic in height. The majority of the density being composed of hydrogen, with a mean density ratio of $0.7138$. To find the helium density we use the abundance of helium to hydrogen, and the relation between the helium mass and proton mass $$\\rho_\\rm{He} = 0.1 n_\\rm{H} m_\\rm{He}.$$ When the helium is added as well the mean ratio ratio creeps up to $0.9972$. To estimate the density of the metals we use that, well, they are the _remaining_ elements, so the ratio of them is just what is left after removing the hydrogen and helium $$\\frac{ \\rho_\\rm{metals} }{ \\rho_\\rm{tot} } = 1 - \\frac{ \\rho_\\rm{H + He} }{ \\rho_\\rm{tot} }$$ which produces the reverse curve to the two other figures, with a low mean ratio of $0.0028$."

    "  > Plotting the pressure for the three cases in the top plot above, shows that the pressure decrease rapidly from zero height and up as expected. The red and purple curves are the pressure obtained using the ideal gas law and the number densities. We then inspect the ratio plot for their differences. First the blue curve, showing the ratio of the gas pressure to the pressure contribution from hydrogen and electrons calculated using the ideal gas law. The curve clearly shows some deviations from the ideal gas law, both in that the ratio is not close to one and that it is not constant. When we add the helium density as well, we see that the ratio approaches one at height $\\sim 300 \\, \\rm{km}$. As we saw earlier when inspecting the ratios of densities of hydrogen and helium to the total density, hydrogen and helium makes up the majority of the total mass. So we would expect the ratio of the pressure to be close to one when including helium, but this is not the case for all heights. This indicate that the ideal gas law is not a good approximation in this model. First this discrepancy was thought to be caused by the missing turbulence in the ideal gas law, but it seems that the model is not including this in the gas pressure, but in the total pressure. Thus this is probably not a correct explanation for the discrepancy."

There is no `proton_density` available for the 3D model, so just use `hydrogen_density` in `compute_hminus_extension`. Each column in the 3D model is like a different 1D atmosphere, so each column has a different $\\tau_{500}$. There are 256x256 columns in the 3D model, so it makes little sense to plot them all.

For this calculation, one usually has to interpolate the $\\tau_{500}$ vs $h$ curve for each line in the model, but a very quick calculation can be made by taking the model height where $\\tau_{500}$ is closest to 1 (nearest neighbour) with `tau1_height = height[numpy.abs(tau - 1).argmin(axis=0)]`, replacing `height` and `tau` by the appropriate arrays.
